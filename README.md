# Beginner_Repo
You could explain something to me a million times, and I probably won't understand it until I get to apply the knowledge somewhere. 

The objective of this git is to demonstrate my understanding of various Data Science concepts such as Statistical methods, Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Data ETL and so on.

The projects found in this repo will which projects I used as my starting points in Data Science, and hopefully as I continue to develop my skills, I can look back to see how much I've grown. 

This portfolio will be divided into 3 parts. 

Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced

The Beginner part will contain basic EDA practices using built-in datasets. This will include 2 datasets, namely IRIS and mtcars.

The Intermediate part will contain Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) practices. This will include sourcing data, cleaning it and analysing it. This may eventually include web-scraping.

The Advanced part will be my attempt at Machine Learning / AI work. 

Progress:

[Paused]: Iris Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In Progress: mtcars EDA
